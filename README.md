# Customer_Segmentation_Using_Clustering-EnsembleLearning


## 📌 Objective
Segment customers into distinct groups using unsupervised clustering techniques and classify them using ensemble learning models to help businesses drive targeted marketing strategies.

## 📁 Datasets Used
- [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)
- E-commerce Customer Data (optional)

## 🧠 Techniques and Algorithms
- 📊 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- ⚙️ Scaling & Normalization (StandardScaler)
- 🌀 **Clustering**:
  - K-Means
  - DBSCAN
- 📉 **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - PCA
- 🌲 **Classification Models**:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Defined the problem statement and business goal
2. Preprocessed and normalized the dataset
3. Applied clustering to segment customers
4. Used clusters as labels for supervised learning
5. Trained Random Forest & XGBoost classifiers
6. Evaluated models using accuracy and classification metrics
7. Visualized clusters and feature importances

## 📈 Results
- Identified 3–5 distinct customer segments
- Achieved high classification accuracy using ensemble models
- Provided insights into customer behavior and value

## 📊 Visualizations
- PCA projection of clusters
- Cluster-wise spending habits
- Feature importances from Random Forest/XGBoost
